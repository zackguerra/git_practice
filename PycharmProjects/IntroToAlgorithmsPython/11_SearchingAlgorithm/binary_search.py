# Linear Search
# - "sorted" set of data
# - Keep comparing the item in the middle of the list to the target value
#   while removing the half of the list from the search range.
# - Time Complexity: O(log n) (how many times you divide n by 2 to get the number
#   (int the worst case, it will take n steps if you have log n elements.)
