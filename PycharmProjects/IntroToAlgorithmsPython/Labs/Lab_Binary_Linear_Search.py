# In this lab, you will be using two searching algorithms we covered in class to
# search for a word in dictionary. Compare the performance for each algorithm.
# You will have to output the number of steps for both algorithms when used for searching
# for the same word. (case-insensitive)
# Your output should look like this. Try to search for 5 different words of your choice.
#
# ex)
# Searching for "orange"...
# Linear Search: {} steps
# Binary Search: {} steps
#
# Searching for "orangeeeeee"...
# Linear Search: no matching word found
# Binary Search: no matching word found
​
​
# Open the dictionary file and read all lines as a list of words.
with open('words') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
​
# Strip off the newline character for each word.
lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]
