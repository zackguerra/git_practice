# Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later.
# A Variable is like a label, and you use '_' symbol, known as
# the assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable.

a = 10
b = c = 20  # This is called a "Chained assignment"
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

greetings = "Hola, como estas? muy bien, y tu?"
print(greetings)

# Variable names contain letters, digits and underscore'_'
# (You can not start with a digit)

# 1apple = "" (not good)
# $asdf! = 20 (not good)
